# üîí Secure Network Design - Cisco Packet Tracer Project

## üì° Project Overview

This project implements a **Secure Network Design** using **Cisco Packet Tracer**, following industry best practices such as:

- VLAN segmentation
- Inter-VLAN Routing via Router-on-a-Stick
- Secure device management with SSH and encrypted passwords
- Access Control Lists (ACLs) for traffic control

|------|------------|-------------------|
| 10   | Admin      | 192.168.10.0/24   |
| 20   | Staff      | 192.168.20.0/24   |
| 30   | Server     | 192.168.30.0/24   |
| 99   | Management | 192.168.99.0/24   |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Steps

1. Place **Router**, **Switch**, **PC0**, **PC1**, and **PC2** in Cisco Packet Tracer.
2. Configure VLANs on the switch.
3. Assign switch ports to appropriate VLANs.
4. Configure Router sub-interfaces for Inter-VLAN Routing.
5. Assign static IP addresses to all devices.
6. Secure the Router and Switch with:
   - Passwords (console, vty, enable secret)
   - SSH access for remote management
   - Password encryption
7. Apply Access Control Lists (ACLs) to control network traffic as needed.
8. Test connectivity:
   - Ping between VLANs
   - SSH access to Router and Switch
